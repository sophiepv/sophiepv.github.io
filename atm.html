		<article><h2>SIXTH GRADE</h2>
			<p>I would never consider myself skilled. There is always so much to learn but not enough time, yet somehow time is too slow when I am learning. I'd like to say I'm a Jack of all Trades; ok at a lot of things but good at nothing. Here's some of my skills: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Typing</li>
			<li>Microsoft Word</li>
			<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
			<li>PowerPoint</li>
			<li>Canva</li>
			<li>Javascript</li>
			
			
	    </ul>
			<p>Yeah, that's about it. I waste time working on improving my artistic skills that may or may not help me in the future.

		<h2> THE PROGRAM ITSELF</h2>
			<p>The ATM program is a very rich and dense elective to take. You learn many useful skills and get fast at typing. It is a lot more thorough than any summer camp you can take, hence it lasts three years. It is a commitment. It is full of challenging programs, many of which are used by graphic design professionals, CAD designers, and everyday use. ATM is not just something to get your feet wet with in the world of computer programs, it is more of a knee deep thing. Usually, each program you learn will have at least a month to cover the topic.
