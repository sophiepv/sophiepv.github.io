		<article> <h2>SKILLS</h2>
			<p>I would never consider myself skilled. There is always so much to learn but not enough time, yet somehow time is too slow when I am learning. I'd like to say I'm a Jack of all Trades; ok at a lot of things but good at nothing. Here's some of my skills: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drawing</li>
			<li>Writing</li>
			<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
			<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
			<li>Photography</li>
			<li>Google Apps</li>
			<li>Cooking</li>
			<li>Painting</li>
			
	    </ul>
			<p>Yeah, that's about it. I waste time working on improving my artistic skills that may or may not help me in the future.

		<article><h2>INTERESTS</h2>
			<p>I have always been interested in different cultures. It is very amusing to see that different people have different ways of life. Because of this, I am very interested in travel and seeing different places. I am also interested in Urban cities. I really just like how so many people can live in one place, all of different cultures and background, forming a community.  </p>
			<p>Second to that, I really like aesthetics. Making things look good and unique has always been something that keeps me going. I enjoy unique fashion styles and and photography.   </p>

		<article><h2>FAMILY</h2>
			<p>I literally only have one sister and a Mother and a Father. </p>
			<p>About my sister: She is your average basic college student who attends UCLA. She is very annoying and gets on my nerves 24/7. </p>
			<p>My mom and dad: They are just my birthgivers who have taught me everything I need to know to be a functioning member of society.</p>
